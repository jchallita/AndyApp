Andy app is all about calculating probabilities for events happening.
 		<h2>ISO</h2>
It is very surprising that ISO 31000 does not include a risk matrix. To this effect, the matrix must be sought from another source.
 		<br>
 		<br>
 		<h2>Discussion</h2>
The fact is that risk is many things to many people.
<br>
For example:
<br>1. Someone investing might be very interested in market volatility.
<br>1. Someone borrowing would like to see the markets stable.
<br>
You can make the numbers say whatever you want them to say. For example, there is a 0.04% chance that a given stock will drop by 20%. This means that it is a very safe bet if you want to buy it. Now look at this:
<br>The probability of the stock falling by 1% is 25%
<br>The probability of the stock falling by 0.5% is 65%
<br>etc.
<br>
<br>As you can see, there is a very high probability that the stock price will change, just by how much is governed by different probabilities.
<br>
<br>
To find out by how much, you must follow the stock. Read the news, follow the company, etc.
<br>
<br>There is a trick that says all numbers in the world contain the digit 3. This is a trick on percentages. Imagine infinity was number 9; then 10% of the numbers would have '3' in them. But infinity is not 9, so let's say it's 99.
<br>
<br>3 + 13 + 23 + 30, 31, .. 39 + 43...
<br>
<br>gives 19%. See as you increase infinity the number increases and tends to 100%.
