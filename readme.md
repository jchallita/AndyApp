This project is based on jQtouch - any version you want, pick and choose. 

I tried all of them, but to be specific, here are the two i spend most time on:
The lasted version found on jqtouch.com
The version that ships with Jonathan Stakr's book on writing Android apps using HTML, JS and CSS. Specifically that version that is bundled with the Kilo app in chapter 6.

The latter is the only one that displays the back button correctly, without having to add the -moz- mirror trick to jqtouch.css.

When i test it on a mobile device as a web app from the device's web browser connecting to my pc, it works perfect.

The thing is that when it compiles, it works well on any iOS device. But when I test it on an Adnroid device, specifically Samsung S3, i just get one screenfull. I try to scroll the page but i don't get anything. 

I hope someone can have a look and tell me what's wrong with this, jQtouch should live to its promise i guess; my other alternative would be to learn Sencha which i tried but found it comlicated and maybe better writing the think in Java altogether?

I hope this also helps others who might be facing the same probles,
